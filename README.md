Embedded Systems Development Lab 1.
This repository contains the fully working code for the "Blinking LED” and the “Digital I/O”
circuits.

Both circuits contains the following components: 
• PIC 16F877A (1 item).
• Red, green, blue, yellow and purple LEDs
• Power and ground sources
• 1 16 MGz crystal oscillator
• 470 OHM Resistor for each LED.
• 2 Capacitors (22pF)
- 5V MCLR with 1K resistor

In addiotional,  the “Digital I/O” circuit contains the push button with 5V power supply and IK resistor.
